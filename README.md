# Smart Cleaning Scheduler

A small project with a big brain.  
This is a Python-based task scheduling app that uses lightweight accountability logic and behavioral awareness to gently push users toward their cleaning goals.

---

## Features

- Collects a cleaning list from user
	-Assigns a task & time randomly from list
	-Starts a clock
	-Optionally rerandomizes the list omitting the finished task
	-stores finished tasks and completion records for future functionality
- Two working executables created for early testing
	-(Prototypes as well as finalized funtionality)

## Current Status

This is a **learning-first** project—built not out of necessity, but curiosity.  
I didn’t want to learn Python through canned exercises or yet another to-do app tutorial. I had a concept in the back of my head for a while:  

> “What if there was a sort of smart scheduling app that worked *with* me to make overwhelming cleaning feel less overwhelming? Something that asked for just a little at a time, assigned a short timer so I didn’t feel trapped, and kept track of everything for easy scheduling?”  

I took that big idea, stripped it down to something I could actually finish, and started coding. Once I hit my “minimum viable project,” I realized I could keep building toward the bigger vision. And here we are.  

Along the way, I also published a simplified voice-based version on Alexa using the core idea. (It was a great learning experience, though I’m taking a break from the Amazon Developer Console for now.):

## About the Creator

I'm Anthony Rogers, a self-taught developer learning to pivot out of the service industry.  
I don’t come from a tech background—I come from fast food lines and customer chaos.  
But I like building things that make sense, solve problems, and feel *good* to use.  
This is my first serious dive into software, and I’m not here to follow the beaten path—I’m here to figure out what I can make when I care about the problem.
